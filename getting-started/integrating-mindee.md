# Integrating Mindee

Once you have your model set up, you'll want to start using it!

## API key

Make sure you've created your API Key before continuing.

To create and manage your API keys, go to the "[API Keys](https://app.mindee.com/api-keys)" section on the Mindee Platform.

Click on create API Key, choose a name for this API Key, and validate.

You're now ready to go!

## Integrate the Mindee API

### Client Libraries

We highly recommend using one of our official [client-libraries-sdk](../integrations/client-libraries-sdk/ "mention") .

For a quick introduction and copy-paste ready code, look in the [quick-start.md](../integrations/client-libraries-sdk/quick-start.md "mention") section.

### No-Code or Low-Code

If you're integrating using a no-code or low-code platform, take a look at the [no-code-integrations](../integrations/no-code-integrations/ "mention") section.
