# FAQ V1 to V2

## üöÄ Why Mindee V2?

At Mindee, we've been listening to our customers and the evolving needs of document automation. Over the past years, we've learned that businesses don't just want to extract data from documents‚Äîthey want to **understand, query, and act** on that data with complete autonomy.

**V2 represents the natural evolution of our AI-powered platform, building on the strong foundation of V1:**

* **From extraction to deeper intelligence**: Enhancing our proven AI capabilities with advanced features like RAG, enabling you to not just extract data but have conversations with your documents
* **From developer-focused to universally accessible**: Building on V1's solid API foundation while adding intuitive self-service tools that empower both technical and non-technical users
* **From powerful APIs to comprehensive platform**: Expanding beyond our robust V1 APIs to offer a complete ecosystem where users can build, test, and deploy document automation solutions with greater flexibility
* **User empowerment**: Proactive tools and insights that help users solve challenges independently when they prefer

We're maintaining V1 to ensure continuity for our existing clients who love its simplicity and reliability, while V2 opens up entirely new possibilities for those ready to explore advanced document intelligence. This isn't a replacement‚Äîit's an evolution that gives you more choices in how you want to work with document automation.

**Both platforms share the same core AI excellence you trust, with V2 offering additional layers of intelligence and user control for those who need them.**

## **üîß Technical Changes**

### **API & Integration Changes**

<details>

<summary>How will API calls change in V2?</summary>

V2 has a completely different approach, where models are fully customizable and unique. As such, there is a single API route to send documents for processing. This single route requires the model ID to be given, along with other optional parameters.

The resulting output has a different output structure which is much more generic to allow for the unique and custom nature of the models.

[See API Reference](https://docs.mindee.com/integrations/api-reference)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use the same V1 API keys in the V2?</summary>

No, V1 and V2 do not share API key information.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will my existing V1 integrations break?</summary>

Paying V1 integrations will not be impacted. Paid customers will retain full access under existing contracts without a defined end date. We do encourage existing users to migrate to the V2 since we will not be adding any features to V1.

Free-tier will lose access to the service on September 15, 2025 regardless of integration.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do authentication methods change in V2?</summary>

V2 authentication is based on the same API key system but with a dedicated set of API keys. You‚Äôll need to create an API key on the V2 platform in order to use the service.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are there webhook capabilities in V2?</summary>

Yes, V2 supports webhook integration for asynchronous document processing.&#x20;

[See Webhook Integration](https://docs.mindee.com/integrations/api-overview/webhooks)

</details>

### Models performance

<details>

<summary>What new document types are supported in V2?</summary>

V2 is now giving the opportunity to start creating a custom extraction model for any document type.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Which countries/languages are supported in V2?</summary>

V2 models are optimized for global use, we support [most languages and alphabets](https://docs.mindee.com/models/data-schema#extraction-guidelines), and thus documents from most countries.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How has accuracy improved in V2?</summary>

V1 uses advanced vision and OCR models, while V2 also includes the latest language models and advanced ensemble learning algorithms. It also gives access to a brand new RAG feature, allowing continuous learning, and automation feature, in order to reach best in class performances to get close to human-level precision.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does processing speed compare between V1 and V2?</summary>

Since Accuracy and Reliability are the key objectives of the V2, there may be a slight increase in response time in some cases.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does V2 support synchronous and asynchronous modes?</summary>

V2 only supports asynchronous modes: polling and webhooks.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I create custom extraction templates?</summary>

Yes, V2 allows full control for the users with interactive model customization.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What file formats are supported?</summary>

Supported formats include PDF, PNG, JPEG, and TIFF, similar to V1. Multi-page PDFs and high-res images are fully compatible.&#x20;

[See more about file formats](https://docs.mindee.com/integrations/api-overview#accepted-file-types)

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I optimize performances for my specific use case?</summary>

In order to optimize the performance of a given model, the first step is to [optimize the data schema fields and guidelines](https://docs.mindee.com/models/data-schema#how-to-build-a-top-performing-data-schema) so that the model performances are globally better. If after this step, some unexpected behavior happen on some isolated templates, the [RAG feature](https://docs.mindee.com/models/improving-accuracy) has to be used to increase performances on these given templates, with no regression on the rest of the flow.

</details>

### Development & Testing

<details>

<summary>Which programming languages are supported in V2?</summary>

We officially support Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Java and .NET, when these are used in conjunction with our official client libraries.

[See Client Libraries](https://docs.mindee.com/integrations/client-libraries-sdk)

However, any language or system able to make an HTTP call and receive a JSON response can be used and supported by the community.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a sandbox environment for testing?</summary>

No. We only have one environment available, which is the one you can use for your tests.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I migrate my existing code to V2?</summary>

You‚Äôll need to create a new code integration. Use one of our official client libraries to speed up this process.

</details>

## üéØ Feature Comparison & Use Cases

### Feature Analysis

<details>

<summary>What features am I losing/gaining in the transition?</summary>

With the transition to V2, you're gaining a much more powerful and flexible platform. While V1 offered prebuilt, static APIs for common document types, V2 introduces a **modular and customizable approach,** allowing you to **build, modify, and iterate on your own extraction models.** You‚Äôll no longer use predefined endpoints ‚Äî instead, you‚Äôll create and manage models via an intuitive UI. You‚Äôll also benefit from a brand new Confidence Score per field, now based on the value predicted itself, to help you take decisions based on mindee predictions with more confidence.

In short, you gain full control, smarter AI, and faster iteration cycles.

The only feature no longer available is the synchronous mode.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What advanced features should I consider adopting?</summary>

V2's most impactful advanced features include:

**AI-Powered Model Customization:**

* **Model creation and Data Schema modification using our AI assistant**: Easily create custom extraction models tailored to your specific document types without technical expertise
* **Interactive model set up**: Easily change the data schema to modify your model behavior in seconds by adding, modifying, removing fields and add specific guidelines.

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):**

* **Document database enhancement**: Add your processed documents to the RAG database to improve extraction accuracy over time
* **AI learning from corrections**: Teach the AI correct answers when it makes mistakes, continuously improving performance for your specific use cases
* **Contextual understanding**: Enable the AI to understand document context and relationships for more accurate data extraction

**Combined Benefits:** These features work together to create a self-improving system that becomes more accurate and efficient as you use it, reducing manual corrections and improving automation success rates.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do you still have a roadmap for APIs of the old platform?</summary>

No ‚Äî V1 APIs are no longer being developed. The focus has fully shifted to V2, which supports more advanced use cases and enables faster iteration. Free plan users will be deprecated on September 15, 2025. We strongly recommend migrating now to benefit from the improved capabilities and avoid service disruption.
