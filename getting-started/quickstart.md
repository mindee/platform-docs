# Quickstart

## Sign Up!

You'll need an account ;-)

You can connect using your Google or Github account, or create an account using good old-fashioned email and password.

## Create a Model

The quickest way is to use a predefined model by selecting one from the catalog.

If there are no pre-built models that suit your needs, you can:

* [Modify a model from the catalog](defining-a-model.md#from-an-existing-model)
* [Create your own model from scratch](defining-a-model.md#from-scratch)

## Test the Model

Be sure to make at least one test on a document, using the [live-test.md](../models/live-test.md "mention") feature.

If it doesn't work as expected, you can modify the Data Schema, as explained in [#modifying-your-data-schema](../models/models-overview.md#modifying-your-data-schema "mention").

## Create an API Key

On the left-hand menu of the Mindee Platform, click [**API Keys**](https://app.mindee.com/api-keys) and create a new key.

## Send a File or URL

You can easily send a file or an URL using one of our officially-supported [client-libraries-sdk](../integrations/client-libraries-sdk/ "mention").

For a quick introduction and ready to use code samples, check out the [quick-start.md](../integrations/client-libraries-sdk/quick-start.md "mention") section.

Otherwise, you can use the built-in client in our [api-reference.md](../integrations/api-reference.md "mention").

## Process the Result

You'll need some way of importing the JSON structure and manipulating it.

For quick testing, we recommend to [process-the-response.md](../integrations/client-libraries-sdk/process-the-response.md "mention") using our client libraries.
