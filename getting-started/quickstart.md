# Quickstart

## Sign Up!

You'll need an account ;-)

You can connect using your Google or Github account, or create an account using good old-fashioned email and password.

## Create a Model

The quickest way is to use a predefined model by selecting one from the catalog.

If there are no pre-built models that suit your needs, you can:

* [Modify a model from the catalog](defining-a-model.md#from-an-existing-model)
* [Create your own model from scratch](defining-a-model.md#from-scratch)

## Test the Model

Be sure to make at least one test on a document, using the Live Test tab.

If it doesn't work as expected, you can modify the Data Schema, as explained in[#modifying-your-data-schema](../features/models/#modifying-your-data-schema "mention").

## Create an API Key

On the left-hand menu of the Mindee Platform, click [**API Keys**](https://app.mindee.com/api-keys) and create a new key.

## Send a File

You can quickly test the API by sending a file using the built-in client in our [api-reference.md](../integrations/api-reference.md "mention").

You can also[#send-a-file](quickstart.md#send-a-file "mention")using one of our officially-supported programming languages.

## Process the Result

You'll need some way of importing the JSON structure and manipulating it.

For quick testing, we recommend to [#process-the-result](quickstart.md#process-the-result "mention") using a scripting language like Python or JavaScript. Compiled languages are supported as well.
