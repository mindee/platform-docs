# Defining a Model

## From an Existing Model

Chances are, there is already a model that at least partly fits your needs.

Click on Catalog to check the prebuilt models, and when clicking on one of them, you'll be able to create a copy to "My Models".

You now have a model with a **prebuilt** data schema that you can modify, using the "Data Schema" tab as explained in more detail in [#modifying-your-data-schema](../extraction-models/models-overview.md#modifying-your-data-schema "mention").

For instance, here is a demo of how to create a model from the Invoice Pre-built model:&#x20;

## From Scratch

If you don't find something that matches your needs in the catalog, you also have the possibility to click on **Create Custom Model.**\
\
You'll have two possibilities :

* upload a sample document&#x20;
* write the document type&#x20;

Our AI Agent will then create a custom model for you.\
\
You now have a model with a **custom** schema that you can modify, using the "Data Schema" tab as explained in more detail in [#modifying-your-data-schema](../extraction-models/models-overview.md#modifying-your-data-schema "mention").\
\
Here is a tutorial that shows how to create a custom model by filling in the document type and by uploading a sample doc.
