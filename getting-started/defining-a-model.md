# Defining a Model

## From an Existing Model

Chances are, there is already a model that at least partly fits your needs.

Click on Catalog to check the prebuilt models, and when clicking on one of them, you'll be able to create a copy to "My Models".&#x20;

You now have a model with a **prebuilt** data schema that you can modify, using the "Data Schema" tab as explained in more detail in [#modifying-your-data-schema](../models/models-overview.md#modifying-your-data-schema "mention").

## From Scratch

If you don't find something that matches your needs in the catalog, you also have the possibility to click on **Create Model.**\
\
You'll reach a dialog box with our AI Agent, that will help you define your data model easily through a discussion. \
Once the AI Agent understood sufficient information according to you, you can ask to create your model. \
\
You now have a model with a **custom** schema that you can modify, using the "Data Schema" tab as explained in more detail in [#modifying-your-data-schema](../models/models-overview.md#modifying-your-data-schema "mention").
