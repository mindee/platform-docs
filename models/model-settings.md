# Model Settings

## Model Name and Cover Image

On the Model Settings page, you'll have the opportunity to modify the model name and the cover image. Feel free to set them up so that the Model will be easy to retrieve among all your other Models.

## Processing Zone

{% include "/.gitbook/includes/model-processing-zone.md" %}

## Storage Policy

{% include "/.gitbook/includes/model-storage-policy.md" %}

## Locking the Data Schema

To prevent unintended changes once your data schema is finalized, you have the option to lock it. This ensures that the model remains stable and any modifications are controlled. You can unlock the data schema when changes are needed.

## Copying, Transferring, Deleting Models

These operations are available in the "Danger Zone" area of the model settings.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Operations in the "Danger Zone" are irreversible!
{% endhint %}
