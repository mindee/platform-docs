# Model Settings

## Model Name and Cover Image

On the Model Settings page, you'll have the opportunity to modify the model name and the cover image. Feel free to set them up so that the Model will be easy to retrieve among all your other Models.

## Processing Zone

This setting determines the geographic region of where your data is processed.

There are 3 available options for processing location:&#x20;

* Europe
* United States
* Global

Selecting **Global** means your data could be processed in Europe and/or the United States.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is only an indication for processing, not support.

You can send documents from any country to the Mindee API!
{% endhint %}

{% include "/.gitbook/includes/model-storage-policy.md" %}

## Locking the Data Schema

To prevent unintended changes once your data schema is finalized, you have the option to lock it. This ensures that the model remains stable and any modifications are controlled. You can unlock the data schema when changes are needed.

## Copying, Transferring, Deleting Models

These operations are available in the "Danger Zone" are of the model settings.
