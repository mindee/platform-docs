# Models Overview

## What is a Model?

A **Model** in the Mindee platform is a configurable and reusable template designed to process documents (an inference in technical terms). Various types of models are available, from simple text recognition to data extraction and classification.

All model use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and sophisticated data processing techniques.

Models allow you to automate the process of turning unstructured document images into actionable, structured data. They can be tailored to different document types and business needs, ensuring that only the most relevant information is captured for your workflows.

On the Models page, you can view, search, and manage all your document extraction models. Each model is represented as a card showing its name, a preview (if available), and a summary of the main fields it extracts. This makes it easy to organize, access, and deploy models for your document processing tasks.

Each Model contains a certain set of tools :

* A dedicated configuration: a model is defined by its configuration, that sets the way the API should extract data for a given type of documents.
* A dedicated set of settings: it gives the capability to change settings of the model such as processing zone, storage policy, ownership transfer ...

## Create a Model

From the Mindee Platform main page, click on **"Create your document AI model".**

From there you can choose the type of model you want to create:

* [Broken link](/broken/pages/ywb5XsDuWyBy07coiRb0 "mention") to extract structured data from documents
* [Broken link](/broken/pages/jqljfGxEsmDTKtOnQDrR "mention") to preprocess or analyze documents

Each type of model will have different creation options.

## Live Test

Once a model is created you can test it directly on the platform. You can use your own files or choose from our samples selection.

More details in the [live-test.md](live-test.md "mention") section.

## Changing Settings

All options are detailed in the [model-settings.md](model-settings.md "mention") section.
