# Utility Models Overview

## What is a Utility Model?

Use our utility models to perform document analysis, or to preprocess documents in a data extraction workflow.

Each utility model is its own independent model without any link to other utility models.\
We only group them together to signal that their use is different from [Broken link](/broken/pages/ywb5XsDuWyBy07coiRb0 "mention").

{% hint style="info" %}
Utility Models are currently in Beta.

To see available integrations, check the model's "Documentation" page on the Mindee Platform.
