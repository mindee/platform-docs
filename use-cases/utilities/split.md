# Split

This utility is designed to allow you automatically breaking a multi-page source file into separate documents and associate a class to each one.&#x20;

## Setup



1. To create a Split utility, you need to click on **Models**, and then on **Create your document AI model**.
2. Under the **Document Utilities** section, click on **Split.**
3. A pop-up will appear, allowing you to enter the classes you want. Each class corresponds to a  document type possibly present in the documents you want to process. \
   \
   &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample: If the files you are receiving may contain invoices, receipts, and driving licenses you may select the three classes "INVOICE", "RECEIPT", "DRIVING LICENSE"._&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Add the class "Other" if you need the model to identify documents that are not one of the precedent document types.
{% endhint %}
