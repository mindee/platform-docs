## Why Use Mindee for Receipts?

Receipts vary immensely in format, country, language, and quality. Mindee simplifies extraction and ensures high reliability by enabling you to:

* Handle global formats: Our model is trained on receipts from over 50 countries, automatically extracting data points regardless of local layout or language.
* Process poor quality inputs: Robustly extracts data from scanned documents, mobile photos, and even handwritten text on certain fields.
* Capture detailed line items: Accurately extract complex, nested data like individual line items, quantities, and prices for granular expense tracking.
* Get structured output with zero configuration: Start instantly with a pre-trained model that extracts standard fields like total amount, date, vendor name, and expense category.

## Two Ways to Start Using the Receipt Model

Mindee offers two paths to start extracting data from receipts:

### **1. Choose Receipt from Our Catalog**&#x20;

Select the "Receipt" model from our Document Catalog to begin using the pre-trained model immediately. It comes pre-configured to extract all standard financial and descriptive fields (merchant name, total, date, line items, etc.) with high accuracy.

### **2. Customize the Model via Data Schema**

You can instantly tailor the pre-trained model to your exact needs. By navigating to the Data Schema interface, you can:

* Add new fields that are unique to your documents (e.g., internal identifiers, specific customer IDs).
* Delete existing fields that are not relevant to your use case.
* Refine the extraction by modifying field types or adding custom instructions for the AI assistant.
