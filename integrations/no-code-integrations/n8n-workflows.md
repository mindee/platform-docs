# n8n Workflows

{% hint style="warning" %}
**The existing Mindee node in n8n is for the legacy v1 version, it will not work for v2.**

We are working on updating the node for the current v2 version.
{% endhint %}

n8n provides all the low-level tooling for integrating Mindee.

To speed things along, you can use this configuration file to get started:

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/n8n_mindeev2-enqueue_and_poll.json" %}
