# Zapier Zaps

## Add Mindee to a Zap <a href="#add-mindee-to-a-make.com-scenario" id="add-mindee-to-a-make.com-scenario"></a>

You can use the Mindee integration as a step in any zap.

When adding a step, search for "mindee" and select **Mindee OCR**:

The Mindee integration has several possible actions, choose "Send File and Get Inference".

The other actions are for specific requirements and are not recommended for general usage.

Once you have the "Send File and Get Inference" action in your Zap, you'll need to connect it to one of your [api-keys.md](../api-keys.md "mention").
