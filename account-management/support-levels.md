## Support Options <a href="#support-options" id="support-options"></a>

### Community Support

All plans include access to our community forum at [feedback.mindee.com](https://feedback.mindee.com/).\
This is the best place to ask questions, exchange ideas with other users, and access responses from the Mindee team.

### Chat Support

Available from the **Pro plan** onward, our Chat connects you directly with our support team via a dedicated chat channel for faster and more direct assistance.

### Priority Support

Included in the **Business plan**, Priority Support ensures that your requests are addressed first in the chat queue, reducing waiting times for critical issues.

## Choosing the Right Level <a href="#choosing-the-right-level" id="choosing-the-right-level"></a>

* **Starter** → For individuals or early-stage projects where community-driven answers are sufficient.
* **Pro** → For teams that benefit from direct access to chat-based support.
* **Business** → For organizations where faster resolution and priority handling are required.
