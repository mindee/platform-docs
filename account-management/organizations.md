# Organizations

### üë• Roles in a Workflow

Each workflow in an organization is governed by a **role system**. A user must be explicitly added to a workflow to access it ‚Äî except for the **creator**, who is automatically granted the `owner` role.

| Role        | Permissions summary                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner`     | Full control of the workflow                             |
| `admin`     | Can manage members (except owners/admins), edit settings |
| `developer` | Can upload documents, tag files, and manage executions   |
| `approver`  | Can view and validate documents                          |
| `operator`  | Can only view/review executions                          |

{% hint style="warning" %}
‚ö†Ô∏è Only one **owner** per workflow. Ownership is set at creation and cannot be transferred via API.
{% endhint %}

### üîê Role Behavior & Rules

* The **creator** of a workflow is always set as its `owner` automatically.
* Organization **admins are not automatically admins** on all workflows.
* **Admins cannot promote, edit, or remove owners or other admins**.
* Users outside of organizations (standalone accounts) are treated as `owners` on all their workflows ‚Äî no roles are enforced.

***

### üì• Role Visibility in API Responses

Every endpoint that includes a `workflow_id` in the path returns a `X-Allowed-Roles` header indicating the roles the current user holds, in ascending hierarchy:

```
operator
operator,approver
operator,approver,developer
operator,approver,developer,admin
operator,approver,developer,admin,owner
```

Use this to manage conditional UI display on the frontend.
