The **Processing Zone** setting determines the geographic region where your document data will be processed. This option can impact compliance with data residency requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Available options:

* **No Preference (Default)**\
  Mindee will automatically route your documents to the closest or most available processing region. This is the recommended default for optimal performance and availability, but your data may be processed in Europe and in the United States.
* **Europe**\
  Forces all data processing to occur exclusively within data centers located in Europe (EU). Recommended for organizations subject to GDPR or EU data residency policies.
* **United States**\
  Forces all data processing to occur exclusively within data centers located in the United States. Recommended for organizations subject to U.S. data governance or compliance policies.

This is only an indication for processing, not support.

You can send documents from any country to the Mindee API!
