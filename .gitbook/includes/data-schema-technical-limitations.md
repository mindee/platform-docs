## Number of Fields in the Data Schema

For your data schema, the recommended maximum number of fields is 25.

Beyond this limit, performance will be drastically reduced.

## Names of Fields

The field _ame_ must only contain:

* lowercase Latin letters without accents (a-z)
* numbers (0-9)
* underscores (`_`)
