When setting the activation state of a feature on the Platform, this will be the default. All API calls will use the default state unless explicitly set otherwise when using the API.

This is useful for project managers, as it allows activating or deactivating a feature across all API calls on that model.

Anyone with write access to the model can set the option's default value.
