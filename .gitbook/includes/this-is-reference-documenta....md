{% hint style="info" %}
**This is reference documentation.**

Code samples shown are only examples, and will not work as-is.\
You'll need to copy-paste and modify according to your requirements.

Looking for a quick TL;DR, or full code samples?

* Take a look at the [quick-start.md](../../integrations/client-libraries-sdk/quick-start.md "mention") page.
* Ask our documentation AI to write code samples for you:\
  <button type="button" class="button primary" data-action="ask" data-query="Write a code sample for my extraction model, ask for my model ID and  language first" data-icon="gitbook-assistant">Ask "Write a code sample for my extraction model, ask for my model ID and  language first"</button>\
  You can also use the "ask" button at the top of any page in the documentation.
