You'll need a valid _input source_, one of:

* a local source created in [load-and-adjust-a-file.md](../../integrations/client-libraries-sdk/load-and-adjust-a-file.md "mention")
* a remote source created in [#use-an-url](../../integrations/client-libraries-sdk/send-a-file-or-url.md#use-an-url "mention")
